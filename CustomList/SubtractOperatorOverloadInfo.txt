As a developer, I want to write documentation in a.txt file that describes the details //      and functionality of my – operator overload. I want to include details such as “syntax”, //      “parameters”, “return type”, and an example of it being used, with the output. I want to use //      the following piece of documentation as a guideline for my own documentation: //      https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cd666k3e%28v=vs.110%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396
